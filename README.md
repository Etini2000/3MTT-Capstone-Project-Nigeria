# Building a Predictive Model for COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in Nigeria. 

## Aim 
To use historical COVID-19 data to develop predictive models to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria.

The <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report">Dataset</a> was downloaded from Kaggle.

### This project involved

1. Data Cleaning and Standardization
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualisation of some relevant trends
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Feature Engineering 
6. Model Development and Evaluation.

For the Predictive Model, **Linear Regression** was used.

### Evaluation Score
**Mean Squared Error: 3.19**

**R-squared: 1.0**

### Additionally

A <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19StatsinAfrica/Dashboard3?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">visualization</a> was created using Tableau to summarize COVID 19 trends in Africa
